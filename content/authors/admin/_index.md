I am an Assistant Professor of Finance at the Kelley School of Business at Indiana University. My research interest lies at the intersection of Return Predictability, Machine Learning, Factor Portfolios, and Financial Econometrics. I am particularly interested in leveraging machine learning tools to improve our understanding of why securities with certain characteristics earn the return they earn.

I was born and raised in Kumasi, Ghana. I received my Bachelor in Business Administration from the University of Ghana Business School, Accra, Ghana, and a Masters in Business Administration and Economics from the Norwegian School of Economics, Bergen, Norway.
