I am a Ph.D. candidate in Finance studying at NOVA School of Business and Economics. My research interest lies at the intersection of Return Predictability, Machine Learning, and Financial Econometrics. I am particularly interested in answering the question of whether or not portfolios that leverage our improved ability to estimate future returns are priced by existing asset pricing models.

I  am happy to announce that I will join The Kelley School of Business at Indiana University in July 2021 as an Acting Assistant Professor.
